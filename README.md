## History
The game originally started out as a school project. For my computer science class I was tasked with making a little game.
While others in my class opted for a terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, I decided to show what I can do and create a bigger game using PyGame.
The inspiration for Cosmic Jumper arose from Google Chrome's "The Dinosaur Game". In the middle of class my wifi turned off, and the famous Dinosaur Game appeared in my Chrome browser.
I started playing a little and thought to myself: "What if I made something similar to this, but even better?"
And so I started researching and coding, and before I knew it, I had a game!

For those interested: I got a proper grade of 92% for this game (which I'm very happy with). :)

## Gameplay
The concept of the game is simple. You play as an astronaut, running on a planet's surface, accumulating a score.
Along the way, you will encounter obstacles - like rocks, comets and UFO's.
Dodge them by jumping, crouching or even hitting them!
Get your highscore up and have fun!
